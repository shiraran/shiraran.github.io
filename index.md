  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-grid">
    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>The game is stuck on the loading screen.</h3>
      <p>Force-quit Picross Quest, ensure you have a stable internet connection, and relaunch. If the issue persists, reboot your device and try again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>I did not receive my rewarded energy after watching an ad.</h3>
      <p>Rewards are granted once the ad finishes. If the ad closes early or fails to load, you will not receive the bonus. Please try again later or contact us with the ad provider name and approximate time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>How do I restore progress on a new device?</h3>
      <p>Ensure you are signed in to the same iCloud account and Game Center profile. Picross Quest syncs mission and achievement progress through Game Center whenever you launch the app with an active connection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-card">
      <h3>The app crashes after the latest update.</h3>
      <p>Delete the app and reinstall from the App Store. Your purchases are tied to your Apple ID and will be restored automatically. If crashes continue, let us know with crash details.</p>

  <h2>Support Policy</h2>
  <p>Picross Quest is actively maintained, and we provide compatibility updates for major iOS releases. If an update causes a regression, please notify us immediately so we can prioritize a fix.</p>
  <p>We follow Apple’s standard <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refund guidelines</a>. For billing concerns, contact Apple Support directly and include your App Store receipt.</p>

  <h2>Data &amp; Privacy</h2>
  <p>Picross Quest stores progress locally on your device and in iCloud Game Center. We use Google AdMob to deliver rewarded ads; ad personalization can be disabled from the in-game settings menu, which requests App Tracking Transparency authorization.</p>
